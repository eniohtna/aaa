The #E Greeks#! arrived in swathes especially, dressed in their finest and eager to see the race begin.

As the first racer from the #Y Basilisks#! rounded the corner, all eyes turned to the spina in the center of the race track, watching the sunlight glimmering on a statuette of a silver dolphin - once this dolphin was removed, everyone knew that it would be the last lap.\n\nMoments into the race, it is anyone's game now - the #Y Scorpions#! lead the way, but soon they are #R rocked off course#! by the #Y Pegusi#!, who are whipping their mounts furiously.
