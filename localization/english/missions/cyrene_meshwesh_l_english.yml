meshwesh_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "We have become a #E Terror of the Desert#!, and all in the sea of sands fear us. The scourge of 'civilized peoples,' there is only one place to go to cement our frightening rule. The #E Land of the Nile#!. There is no greater civilization to overthrow. There is no greater feat to be done. This will be the magnus opus of our people, and those a thousand years into the future will talk of us as those a thousand years ago watch on in either pleasure or horror.\n\nHalf a millenia ago, the first #E Libyan#! dynasty ruled over the children of #E Ra#!. It was a time of the #E Great Chiefs of Ma#!, or the #E Meshwesh#!. There would be a total of two dynasties ruled under the #E Meshwesh#! chiefs, the #E 22nd#! and #E 23rd#! dynasties."
meshwesh_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when the #E Great Chief of Ma#! has returned to their throne in the Delta, returning #E Libyan#! rule to the pharonic throne for the first time since #E 22nd#! and #E 23rd#! Dynasties of Egypt."
